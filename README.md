# POP_OS-Security-Clone
Pop!_OS-Style Landing Page
A responsive single-page website that recreates the look and feel of System76’s Pop!_OS homepage.
Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it features:

Hero section with call-to-action buttons

Product/feature highlights and image sections

Embedded YouTube intro video

Testimonial slider with navigation controls

Footer with social icons and subscription prompt
Workflow

My project follows a simple, clean workflow.

Structure first: I started by laying out the full HTML skeleton—navbar, hero section, product highlights, testimonials, and footer—so the page had a clear hierarchy from top to bottom.

Styling second: Then I added CSS to make it responsive and visually consistent: flexible grids, spacing, colors, and typography that resemble the Pop!_OS brand.

Interactivity last: Finally, I wrote a small JavaScript file. It powers the testimonial slider, the “Download” button that links to the official Pop!_OS download page, and prepares hooks for any future features like search or form handling.
